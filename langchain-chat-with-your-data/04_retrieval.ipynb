And so when there are \\nhomework assignments or things like that, we usually won't sort of — in the mission of \\nsaving trees, we will usually not give out many handouts in class. So homework \\nassignments, homework solutions will be posted online at the course home page.  \\nAs far as this class, I've also written, and I guess I've also revised every year a set of \\nfairly detailed lecture notes that cover the technical content of this class. And so if you \\nvisit the course homepage, you'll also find the detailed lecture notes that go over in detail \\nall the math and equations and so on that I'll be doing in class.  \\nThere's also a newsgroup, su.class.cs229, also written on the handout. This is a \\nnewsgroup that's sort of a forum for people in the class to get to know each other and \\nhave whatever discussions you want to have amongst yourselves. So the class newsgroup \\nwill not be monitored by the TAs and me. But this is a place for you to form study groups \\nor find project partners or discuss homework problems and so on, and it's not monitored \\nby the TAs and me. So feel free to talk trash about this class there.  \\nIf you want to contact the teaching staff, please use the email address written down here, \\ncs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu.
