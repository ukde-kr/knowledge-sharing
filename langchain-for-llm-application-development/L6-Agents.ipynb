      "Summary: 300 is a 2006 American epic historical action film directed by Zack Snyder, who co-wrote the screenplay with Kurt Johnstad and Michael B. Gordon. It is based on the 1998 comic book limited series of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. The film, like its source material, is a fictionalized retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae in the Greco-Persian Wars. The plot revolves around King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), who leads 300 Spartans into battle against the Persian \"God-King\" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers. As the battle rages, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. The film also features Michael Fassbender in his film debut.\n",
      "The story is framed by a voice-over narrative by the Spartan soldier Dilios (David Wenham). Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing 300 within the genre of historical fantasy. 300 was filmed mostly with a superimposition chroma key technique to replicate the imagery of the original comics.\n",
      "An unfinished cut of 300 premiered at the Austin Butt-Numb-A-Thon on December 9, 2006. The completed film then premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 14, 2007, before being released in both conventional and IMAX screens in the United States on March 9, and on home media on July 31. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its visuals and style but criticized its historical inaccuracies, most notably its depiction of the Persians, which some characterized as Persophobic. Grossing over $456 million, the film's opening was the 24th-largest in box office history at the time, and became the tenth highest-grossing film of 2007. The film earned a leading ten nominations at the 34th Saturn Awards, winning two for Best Action, Adventure, or Thriller Film and Best Director (for Snyder). A sequel, titled Rise of an Empire, based on Miller's previously unpublished graphic novel prequel Xerxes, was released on March 7, 2014.\n",

      "Summary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\n",
      "Rumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \"Chains & Whips\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \"Not Like Us\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\n",
      "Let God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \"Ace Trumpets\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \"Chains & Whips\" and \"So Far Ahead\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \"So Be It\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour wit\"\n",

      "Summary: Monty Python, also known as the Pythons, were a British comedy troupe formed in 1969 consisting of Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. The group came to prominence for the sketch comedy television series Monty Python's Flying Circus, which aired on the BBC from 1969 to 1974. Their work then developed into a larger collection that included live shows, films, albums, books, and musicals; their influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music. Their sketch show has been called \"an important moment in the evolution of television comedy\".\n",
      "Monty Python's Flying Circus was loosely structured as a sketch show, but its innovative stream-of-consciousness approach and Gilliam's animation skills pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content. A self-contained comedy unit, the Pythons had creative control that allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. They followed their television work by making  the films Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Life of Brian (1979), and The Meaning of Life (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while it has coloured the work of the early editions of Saturday Night Live through to absurdist trends in television comedy.\n",
      "At the 41st British Academy Film Awards in 1988, Monty Python received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. In 1998, they were awarded the AFI Star Award by the American Film Institute. Holy Grail and Life of Brian are frequently ranked on lists of the greatest comedy films. A 2005 poll asked more than 300 comedians, comedy writers, producers, and directors to name the greatest comedians of all time, and half of Monty Python's members made the top 50.\n",

      "Summary: Monty Python's Flying Circus (also known as simply Monty Python) is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam, who became known collectively as \"Monty Python\", or the \"Pythons\". The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. A feature film adaptation of several sketches, And Now for Something Completely Different, was released in 1971.\n",
      "The series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags, and observational sketches without punchlines. Live-action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q..., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series's characters, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \"Seventh Python\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.\n",
      "The programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television. Much of the humour in the series targeted the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, as well as aspects of politics. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded so completely that the adjective \"Pythonesque\" was invented to define it and, later, similar material. Their humour was not\"\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025.

The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. A feature film adaptation of several sketches, And Now for Something Completely Different, was released in 1971.\\nThe series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags, and observational sketches without punchlines.

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

The group came to prominence for the sketch comedy television series Monty Python's Flying Circus, which aired on the BBC from 1969 to 1974. Their work then developed into a larger collection that included live shows, films, albums, books, and musicals; their influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music. Their sketch show has been called \\\"an important moment in the evolution of television comedy\\\".\\nMonty Python's Flying Circus was loosely structured as a sketch show, but its innovative stream-of-consciousness approach and Gilliam's animation skills pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content. A self-contained comedy unit, the Pythons had creative control that allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. They followed their television work by making  the films Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Life of Brian (1979), and The Meaning of Life (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while it has coloured the work of the early editions of Saturday Night Live through to absurdist trends in television comedy.\\nAt the 41st British Academy Film Awards in 1988, Monty Python received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. In 1998, they were awarded the AFI Star Award by the American Film Institute. Holy Grail and Life of Brian are frequently ranked on lists of the greatest comedy films.

The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. A feature film adaptation of several sketches, And Now for Something Completely Different, was released in 1971.\\nThe series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags, and observational sketches without punchlines. Live-action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q..., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series's characters, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \\\"Seventh Python\\\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.\\nThe programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television. Much of the humour in the series targeted the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, as well as aspects of politics. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works.

The group came to prominence for the sketch comedy television series Monty Python's Flying Circus, which aired on the BBC from 1969 to 1974. Their work then developed into a larger collection that included live shows, films, albums, books, and musicals; their influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music. Their sketch show has been called \"an important moment in the evolution of television comedy\".\n",
      "Monty Python's Flying Circus was loosely structured as a sketch show, but its innovative stream-of-consciousness approach and Gilliam's animation skills pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content. A self-contained comedy unit, the Pythons had creative control that allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. They followed their television work by making  the films Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Life of Brian (1979), and The Meaning of Life (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while it has coloured the work of the early editions of Saturday Night Live through to absurdist trends in television comedy.\n",

      "Summary: Monty Python's Flying Circus (also known as simply Monty Python) is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam, who became known collectively as \"Monty Python\", or the \"Pythons\". The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. A feature film adaptation of several sketches, And Now for Something Completely Different, was released in 1971.\n",
      "The series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags, and observational sketches without punchlines. Live-action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q..., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series's characters, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \"Seventh Python\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.\n",

Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works.

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV.

      "Summary: Monty Python's Flying Circus (also known as simply Monty Python) is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam, who became known collectively as \"Monty Python\", or the \"Pythons\". The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. A feature film adaptation of several sketches, And Now for Something Completely Different, was released in 1971.\n",
      "The series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags, and observational sketches without punchlines. Live-action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q..., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series's characters, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \"Seventh Python\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.\n",
      "The programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television. Much of the humour in the series targeted the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, as well as aspects of politics. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded so completely that the adjective \"Pythonesque\" was invented to define it and, later, similar material.

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour wit\\nThought:It seems like the Wikipedia tool did not provide relevant information for sorting a list of customers by last name and then first name.

The group came to prominence for the sketch comedy television series Monty Python's Flying Circus, which aired on the BBC from 1969 to 1974.

A self-contained comedy unit, the Pythons had creative control that allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. They followed their television work by making  the films Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Life of Brian (1979), and The Meaning of Life (1983).

The group came to prominence for the sketch comedy television series Monty Python's Flying Circus, which aired on the BBC from 1969 to 1974.

      "Monty Python's Flying Circus was loosely structured as a sketch show, but its innovative stream-of-consciousness approach and Gilliam's animation skills pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content.

They followed their television work by making  the films Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Life of Brian (1979), and The Meaning of Life (1983).

      "Summary: Monty Python's Flying Circus (also known as simply Monty Python) is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam, who became known collectively as \"Monty Python\", or the \"Pythons\". The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. A feature film adaptation of several sketches, And Now for Something Completely Different, was released in 1971.\n",
      "The series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags, and observational sketches without punchlines. Live-action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q..., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series's characters, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \"Seventh Python\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.\n",
      "The programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television. Much of the humour in the series targeted the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, as well as aspects of politics. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded so completely that the adjective \"Pythonesque\" was invented to define it and, later, similar material.

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

A feature film adaptation of several sketches, And Now for Something Completely Different, was released in 1971.\\nThe series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags, and observational sketches without punchlines. Live-action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q..., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series's characters, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \\\"Seventh Python\\\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.\\nThe programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television.

The group came to prominence for the sketch comedy television series Monty Python's Flying Circus, which aired on the BBC from 1969 to 1974.

A self-contained comedy unit, the Pythons had creative control that allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. They followed their television work by making  the films Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Life of Brian (1979), and The Meaning of Life (1983).

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025.

      "Monty Python's Flying Circus was loosely structured as a sketch show, but its innovative stream-of-consciousness approach and Gilliam's animation skills pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content. A self-contained comedy unit, the Pythons had creative control that allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. They followed their television work by making  the films Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Life of Brian (1979), and The Meaning of Life (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while it has coloured the work of the early editions of Saturday Night Live through to absurdist trends in television comedy.\n",

      "Summary: Monty Python's Flying Circus (also known as simply Monty Python) is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam, who became known collectively as \"Monty Python\", or the \"Pythons\". The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. A feature film adaptation of several sketches, And Now for Something Completely Different, was released in 1971.\n",
      "The series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags, and observational sketches without punchlines. Live-action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q..., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series's characters, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \"Seventh Python\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.\n",
      "The programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television.

Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works.

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

      "Summary: Monty Python's Flying Circus (also known as simply Monty Python) is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam, who became known collectively as \"Monty Python\", or the \"Pythons\". The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. A feature film adaptation of several sketches, And Now for Something Completely Different, was released in 1971.\n",
      "The series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags, and observational sketches without punchlines. Live-action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q..., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series's characters, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \"Seventh Python\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.\n",

Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works.

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. A feature film adaptation of several sketches, And Now for Something Completely Different, was released in 1971.\\nThe series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags, and observational sketches without punchlines. Live-action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q..., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series's characters, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \\\"Seventh Python\\\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.\\nThe programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television. Much of the humour in the series targeted the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, as well as aspects of politics. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded so completely that the adjective \\\"Pythonesque\\\" was invented to define it and, later, similar material.

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

      "Summary: Monty Python's Flying Circus (also known as simply Monty Python) is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam, who became known collectively as \"Monty Python\", or the \"Pythons\". The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. A feature film adaptation of several sketches, And Now for Something Completely Different, was released in 1971.\n",
      "The series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags, and observational sketches without punchlines. Live-action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q..., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series's characters, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \"Seventh Python\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.\n",
      "The programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television. Much of the humour in the series targeted the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, as well as aspects of politics. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded so completely that the adjective \"Pythonesque\" was invented to define it and, later, similar material.

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour wit\\nThought:It seems like the Wikipedia tool did not provide relevant information for sorting a list of customers by last name and then first name.

It was initially surprise released on vinyl on July 19, 2024, as a gift to customers of Third Man Records, before a wider digital release on August 2, 2024. The record was written, recorded, and produced entirely by White at Third Man Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Musically, it is a garage rock, blues rock, and punk blues album.\\nInitially, the album was released through unmarked white vinyl records secretly included with purchases at Third Man Records store locations in Detroit, London, and Nashville, and mailed to vinyl subscribers. A number of copies on blue vinyl were then sold at White's live shows, before a wide release of the album, revealed to be titled No Name, was announced. The unconventional release structure of the album drew attention and has been discussed by media outlets.\\nNo Name received acclaim from music critics, who praised White for returning to his blues and garage roots, and favorably compared it to his work with the White Stripes. Additionally, it received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number 130 on the Billboard 200, the lowest of White's albums, which is believed to be due to its release method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Let God Sort Em Out\\nSummary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\".

The group came to prominence for the sketch comedy television series Monty Python's Flying Circus, which aired on the BBC from 1969 to 1974.

Their sketch show has been called \\\"an important moment in the evolution of television comedy\\\".\\nMonty Python's Flying Circus was loosely structured as a sketch show, but its innovative stream-of-consciousness approach and Gilliam's animation skills pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content. A self-contained comedy unit, the Pythons had creative control that allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. They followed their television work by making  the films Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Life of Brian (1979), and The Meaning of Life (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while it has coloured the work of the early editions of Saturday Night Live through to absurdist trends in television comedy.\\nAt the 41st British Academy Film Awards in 1988, Monty Python received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. In 1998, they were awarded the AFI Star Award by the American Film Institute. Holy Grail and Life of Brian are frequently ranked on lists of the greatest comedy films.
