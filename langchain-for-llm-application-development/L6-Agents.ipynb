      "Summary: 300 is a 2006 American epic historical action film directed by Zack Snyder, who co-wrote the screenplay with Kurt Johnstad and Michael B. Gordon. It is based on the 1998 comic book limited series of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. The film, like its source material, is a fictionalized retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae in the Greco-Persian Wars. The plot revolves around King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), who leads 300 Spartans into battle against the Persian \"God-King\" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers. As the battle rages, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. The film also features Michael Fassbender in his film debut.\n",
      "The story is framed by a voice-over narrative by the Spartan soldier Dilios (David Wenham). Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing 300 within the genre of historical fantasy. 300 was filmed mostly with a superimposition chroma key technique to replicate the imagery of the original comics.\n",
      "An unfinished cut of 300 premiered at the Austin Butt-Numb-A-Thon on December 9, 2006. The completed film then premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 14, 2007, before being released in both conventional and IMAX screens in the United States on March 9, and on home media on July 31. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its visuals and style but criticized its historical inaccuracies, most notably its depiction of the Persians, which some characterized as Persophobic. Grossing over $456 million, the film's opening was the 24th-largest in box office history at the time, and became the tenth highest-grossing film of 2007. The film earned a leading ten nominations at the 34th Saturn Awards, winning two for Best Action, Adventure, or Thriller Film and Best Director (for Snyder). A sequel, titled Rise of an Empire, based on Miller's previously unpublished graphic novel prequel Xerxes, was released on March 7, 2014.\n",

      "Summary: A milliradian (SI-symbol mrad, sometimes also abbreviated mil) is an SI derived unit for angular measurement which is defined as a thousandth of a radian (0.001 radian). Milliradians are used in adjustment of firearm sights by adjusting the angle of the sight compared to the barrel (up, down, left, or right). Milliradians are also used for comparing shot groupings, or to compare the difficulty of hitting different sized shooting targets at different distances. When using a scope with both mrad adjustment and a reticle with mrad markings (called an \"mrad/mrad scope\"), the shooter can use the reticle as a ruler to count the number of mrads a shot was off-target, which directly translates to the sight adjustment needed to hit the target with a follow-up shot. Optics with mrad markings in the reticle can also be used to make a range estimation of a known size target, or vice versa, to determine a target size if the distance is known, a practice called \"milling\".\n",
      "Milliradians are generally used for very small angles, which allows for very accurate mathematical approximations to more easily calculate with direct proportions, back and forth between the angular separation observed in an optic, linear subtension on target, and range. In such applications it is useful to use a unit for target size that is a thousandth of the unit for range, for instance by using the metric units millimeters for target size and meters for range. This coincides with the definition of the milliradian where the arc length is defined as ⁠1/1,000⁠ of the radius. A common adjustment value in firearm sights is 1 cm at 100 meters which equals ⁠10 mm/100 m⁠ = ⁠1/10⁠ mrad.\n",
      "The true definition of a milliradian is based on a unit circle with a radius of one and an arc divided into 1,000 mrad per radian, hence 2,000 π or approximately 6,283.185 milliradians in one turn, and rifle scope adjustments and reticles are calibrated to this definition. There are also other definitions used for land mapping and artillery which are rounded to more easily be divided into smaller parts for use with compasses, which are then often referred to as \"mils\", \"lines\", or similar. For instance there are artillery sights and compasses with 6,400 NATO mils, 6,000 Warsaw Pact mils or 6,300 Swedish \"streck\" per turn inst\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary: A milliradian (SI-symbol mrad, sometimes also abbreviated mil) is an SI derived unit for angular measurement which is defined as a thousandth of a radian (0.001 radian). Milliradians are used in adjustment of firearm sights by adjusting the angle of the sight compared to the barrel (up, down, left, or right). Milliradians are also used for comparing shot groupings, or to compare the difficulty of hitting different sized shooting targets at different distances. When using a scope with both mrad adjustment and a reticle with mrad markings (called an \"mrad/mrad scope\"), the shooter can use the reticle as a ruler to count the number of mrads a shot was off-target, which directly translates to the sight adjustment needed to hit the target with a follow-up shot. Optics with mrad markings in the reticle can also be used to make a range estimation of a known size target, or vice versa, to determine a target size if the distance is known, a practice called \"milling\".\n",

      "Summary: In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\n",

      "Page: In-place algorithm\n",
      "Summary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\n",
      "In-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \n",
      "An algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\n",

      "Page: Topological sorting\n",
      "Summary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary: Let God Sort Em Out is the fourth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Clipse. Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\n",
      "Rumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \"Chains & Whips\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \"Not Like Us\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\n",
      "Let God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \"Ace Trumpets\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \"Chains & Whips\" and \"So Far Ahead\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \"So Be It\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\n",

Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\n",

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\n",
      "In-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \n",
      "An algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\n",

      "Summary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\"\n",

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: In-place algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:\"\n",

      "Summary: A comparison sort is a type of sorting algorithm that only reads the list elements through a single abstract comparison operation (often a \"less than or equal to\" operator or a three-way comparison) that determines which of two elements should occur first in the final sorted list. The only requirement is that the operator forms a total preorder over the data, with:\n",
      "\n",
      "if a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity)\n",
      "for all a and b, a ≤ b or b ≤ a (connexity).\n",
      "It is possible that both a ≤ b and b ≤ a; in this case either may come first in the sorted list. In a stable sort, the input order determines the sorted order in this case.\n",
      "Comparison sorts studied in the literature are \"comparison-based\". Elements a and b can be swapped or otherwise re-arranged by the algorithm only when the order between these elements has been established based on the outcomes of prior comparisons. This is the case when the order between a and b can be derived via the transitive closure of these prior comparison outcomes. \n",
      "For comparison-based sorts the decision to execute basic operations other than comparisons is based on the outcome of comparisons. Hence in a time analysis the number of executed comparisons is used to determine upper bound estimates for the number of executed basic operations such as swaps or assignments.    \n",
      "A metaphor for thinking about comparison sorts is that someone has a set of unlabelled weights and a balance scale. Their goal is to line up the weights in order by their weight without any information except that obtained by placing two weights on the scale and seeing which one is heavier (or if they weigh the same).\n",

When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide relevant information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

The only requirement is that the operator forms a total preorder over the data, with:\\n\\nif a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity)\\nfor all a and b, a ≤ b or b ≤ a (connexity).\\nIt is possible that both a ≤ b and b ≤ a; in this case either may come first in the sorted list. In a stable sort, the input order determines the sorted order in this case.\\nComparison sorts studied in the literature are \\\"comparison-based\\\". Elements a and b can be swapped or otherwise re-arranged by the algorithm only when the order between these elements has been established based on the outcomes of prior comparisons. This is the case when the order between a and b can be derived via the transitive closure of these prior comparison outcomes. \\nFor comparison-based sorts the decision to execute basic operations other than comparisons is based on the outcome of comparisons. Hence in a time analysis the number of executed comparisons is used to determine upper bound estimates for the number of executed basic operations such as swaps or assignments.    \\nA metaphor for thinking about comparison sorts is that someone has a set of unlabelled weights and a balance scale. Their goal is to line up the weights in order by their weight without any information except that obtained by placing two weights on the scale and seeing which one is heavier (or if they weigh the same).\\n\\nPage: Sorting algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: Bubble sort\\nSummary: Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.\\nThought:\",\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed.

      "Summary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\"\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: In-place algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:\"\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: In-place algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists.

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\n",

However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \n",

      "Summary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\"\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool.

Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: In-place algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:\",\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool.

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks.

Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:\"\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool.

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length.

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set.

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

      "Summary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\"\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: In-place algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

The only requirement is that the operator forms a total preorder over the data, with:\\n\\nif a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity)\\nfor all a and b, a ≤ b or b ≤ a (connexity).\\nIt is possible that both a ≤ b and b ≤ a; in this case either may come first in the sorted list.

These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:\",\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: In-place algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool.

An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: Comparison sort\\nSummary: A comparison sort is a type of sorting algorithm that only reads the list elements through a single abstract comparison operation (often a \\\"less than or equal to\\\" operator or a three-way comparison) that determines which of two elements should occur first in the final sorted list. The only requirement is that the operator forms a total preorder over the data, with:\\n\\nif a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity)\\nfor all a and b, a ≤ b or b ≤ a (connexity).\\nIt is possible that both a ≤ b and b ≤ a; in this case either may come first in the sorted list. In a stable sort, the input order determines the sorted order in this case.\\nComparison sorts studied in the literature are \\\"comparison-based\\\". Elements a and b can be swapped or otherwise re-arranged by the algorithm only when the order between these elements has been established based on the outcomes of prior comparisons. This is the case when the order between a and b can be derived via the transitive closure of these prior comparison outcomes. \\nFor comparison-based sorts the decision to execute basic operations other than comparisons is based on the outcome of comparisons. Hence in a time analysis the number of executed comparisons is used to determine upper bound estimates for the number of executed basic operations such as swaps or assignments.    \\nA metaphor for thinking about comparison sorts is that someone has a set of unlabelled weights and a balance scale. Their goal is to line up the weights in order by their weight without any information except that obtained by placing two weights on the scale and seeing which one is heavier (or if they weigh the same).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.

Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: Bubble sort\\nSummary: Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: In-place algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide relevant information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

The only requirement is that the operator forms a total preorder over the data, with:\\n\\nif a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity)\\nfor all a and b, a ≤ b or b ≤ a (connexity).\\nIt is possible that both a ≤ b and b ≤ a; in this case either may come first in the sorted list.

Elements a and b can be swapped or otherwise re-arranged by the algorithm only when the order between these elements has been established based on the outcomes of prior comparisons. This is the case when the order between a and b can be derived via the transitive closure of these prior comparison outcomes. \\nFor comparison-based sorts the decision to execute basic operations other than comparisons is based on the outcome of comparisons. Hence in a time analysis the number of executed comparisons is used to determine upper bound estimates for the number of executed basic operations such as swaps or assignments.    \\nA metaphor for thinking about comparison sorts is that someone has a set of unlabelled weights and a balance scale.

These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:\"\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The only requirement is that the operator forms a total preorder over the data, with:\\n\\nif a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity)\\nfor all a and b, a ≤ b or b ≤ a (connexity).\\nIt is possible that both a ≤ b and b ≤ a; in this case either may come first in the sorted list. In a stable sort, the input order determines the sorted order in this case.\\nComparison sorts studied in the literature are \\\"comparison-based\\\". Elements a and b can be swapped or otherwise re-arranged by the algorithm only when the order between these elements has been established based on the outcomes of prior comparisons. This is the case when the order between a and b can be derived via the transitive closure of these prior comparison outcomes. \\nFor comparison-based sorts the decision to execute basic operations other than comparisons is based on the outcome of comparisons. Hence in a time analysis the number of executed comparisons is used to determine upper bound estimates for the number of executed basic operations such as swaps or assignments.    \\nA metaphor for thinking about comparison sorts is that someone has a set of unlabelled weights and a balance scale. Their goal is to line up the weights in order by their weight without any information except that obtained by placing two weights on the scale and seeing which one is heavier (or if they weigh the same).\\n\\nPage: Sorting algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.

These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: In-place algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide relevant information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

Elements a and b can be swapped or otherwise re-arranged by the algorithm only when the order between these elements has been established based on the outcomes of prior comparisons. This is the case when the order between a and b can be derived via the transitive closure of these prior comparison outcomes. \\nFor comparison-based sorts the decision to execute basic operations other than comparisons is based on the outcome of comparisons.

These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: In-place algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.

These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers.

More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: In-place algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:\",\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool.

Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\\n\\nThe output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\\nThe output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\\n\\nPage: In-place algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

The only requirement is that the operator forms a total preorder over the data, with:\\n\\nif a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity)\\nfor all a and b, a ≤ b or b ≤ a (connexity).\\nIt is possible that both a ≤ b and b ≤ a; in this case either may come first in the sorted list. In a stable sort, the input order determines the sorted order in this case.\\nComparison sorts studied in the literature are \\\"comparison-based\\\". Elements a and b can be swapped or otherwise re-arranged by the algorithm only when the order between these elements has been established based on the outcomes of prior comparisons. This is the case when the order between a and b can be derived via the transitive closure of these prior comparison outcomes. \\nFor comparison-based sorts the decision to execute basic operations other than comparisons is based on the outcome of comparisons. Hence in a time analysis the number of executed comparisons is used to determine upper bound estimates for the number of executed basic operations such as swaps or assignments.    \\nA metaphor for thinking about comparison sorts is that someone has a set of unlabelled weights and a balance scale. Their goal is to line up the weights in order by their weight without any information except that obtained by placing two weights on the scale and seeing which one is heavier (or if they weigh the same).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

      "Summary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\"\n",

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists.

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings.

These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.

The only requirement is that the operator forms a total preorder over the data, with:\\n\\nif a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity)\\nfor all a and b, a ≤ b or b ≤ a (connexity).\\nIt is possible that both a ≤ b and b ≤ a; in this case either may come first in the sorted list. In a stable sort, the input order determines the sorted order in this case.\\nComparison sorts studied in the literature are \\\"comparison-based\\\". Elements a and b can be swapped or otherwise re-arranged by the algorithm only when the order between these elements has been established based on the outcomes of prior comparisons. This is the case when the order between a and b can be derived via the transitive closure of these prior comparison outcomes. \\nFor comparison-based sorts the decision to execute basic operations other than comparisons is based on the outcome of comparisons. Hence in a time analysis the number of executed comparisons is used to determine upper bound estimates for the number of executed basic operations such as swaps or assignments.    \\nA metaphor for thinking about comparison sorts is that someone has a set of unlabelled weights and a balance scale. Their goal is to line up the weights in order by their weight without any information except that obtained by placing two weights on the scale and seeing which one is heavier (or if they weigh the same).\\n\\nPage: Topological sorting\\nSummary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks.

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it.

In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers.

More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used.

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

The only requirement is that the operator forms a total preorder over the data, with:\\n\\nif a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity)\\nfor all a and b, a ≤ b or b ≤ a (connexity).\\nIt is possible that both a ≤ b and b ≤ a; in this case either may come first in the sorted list. In a stable sort, the input order determines the sorted order in this case.\\nComparison sorts studied in the literature are \\\"comparison-based\\\". Elements a and b can be swapped or otherwise re-arranged by the algorithm only when the order between these elements has been established based on the outcomes of prior comparisons. This is the case when the order between a and b can be derived via the transitive closure of these prior comparison outcomes. \\nFor comparison-based sorts the decision to execute basic operations other than comparisons is based on the outcome of comparisons. Hence in a time analysis the number of executed comparisons is used to determine upper bound estimates for the number of executed basic operations such as swaps or assignments.    \\nA metaphor for thinking about comparison sorts is that someone has a set of unlabelled weights and a balance scale. Their goal is to line up the weights in order by their weight without any information except that obtained by placing two weights on the scale and seeing which one is heavier (or if they weigh the same).\\n\\nPage: Sorting algorithm\\nSummary: In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.

These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \\\"bubble\\\" up to the top of the list.\\nIt performs poorly in real-world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers.

More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Self-released on July 11, 2025, it marks the duo's first album since Til the Casket Drops (2009); Pusha T and Malice split in 2010, before reuniting in 2019 and starting work on the album in 2023. Longtime collaborator and mentor Pharrell Williams returns as the album's executive and only producer after splitting with his Neptunes collaborator Chad Hugo; he also appears as a guest, alongside Ab-Liva (of Clipse side-project Re-Up Gang), John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Stove God Cooks, The-Dream, Tyler, the Creator, and the choir ensemble Voices of Fire. Additional contributors include Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.\\nRumors of a new Clipse album started in 2023 when Williams, who became creator director of menswear at luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton the same year, included a new Clipse song in the soundtrack to the Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2024 Show. The album's recording sessions were primarily split between studios in the trio's home state of Virginia and the Louis Vuitton headquarters in Paris, France. Originally planned for a 2024 release, the album was delayed when the duo's then-label Def Jam Recordings and its parent company Universal Music Group demanded Lamar's guest verse on \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" be either censored or removed. Although the label cited worry about blowback from United States President Donald Trump due to the lyrics, Pusha T publicly claimed it was over his and Lamar's public feuds with rapper Drake, who filed a lawsuit against Universal in 2025 for its publication of Lamar's diss \\\"Not Like Us\\\". Refusing to censor the verse, Clipse paid a seven-figure sum to be dropped from the deal, signing a distribution deal with Roc Nation instead but giving Def Jam a percentage of the profits from the album. The album's lyrical content and promotional press received media attention for Pusha T's outspoken criticism of his rivals Drake and Jim Jones, as well as former creative partners Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West) and Travis Scott.\\nLet God Sort Em Out received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the duo's raw, introspective lyricism and longstanding chemistry; a few felt Williams' production was overpolished and held back its potential. It was preceded by one single, \\\"Ace Trumpets\\\", released on May 30, 2025. Although no other songs were released as standalone singles, \\\"Chains & Whips\\\" and \\\"So Far Ahead\\\" were serviced to the album's Apple Music page the evening before its release; the former would also receive a music video along with \\\"So Be It\\\". Clipse are embarking on the Let God Sort Em Out Tour with EarthGang from August to November 2025 in additional promotion of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: C Sharp (programming language)\\nSummary: C# ( see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\\nThe principal inventors of the C# programming language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde from Microsoft. It was first widely distributed in July 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio, both of which are technically speaking, closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Microsoft Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\\nThought:It seems like the search results did not provide direct information on how to sort a list of customers by last name and then first name using programming.

The only requirement is that the operator forms a total preorder over the data, with:\\n\\nif a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity)\\nfor all a and b, a ≤ b or b ≤ a (connexity).\\nIt is possible that both a ≤ b and b ≤ a; in this case either may come first in the sorted list.

Hence in a time analysis the number of executed comparisons is used to determine upper bound estimates for the number of executed basic operations such as swaps or assignments.    \\nA metaphor for thinking about comparison sorts is that someone has a set of unlabelled weights and a balance scale.

      "Summary: In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\n",
      "Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\n",
      "The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\n",
      "Although some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: In-place algorithm\n",
      "Summary: In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\n",
      "In-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the lengths of indices and pointers.  \n",
      "An algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theoretical applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is write-only).\n",

      "Page: Topological sorting\n",
      "Summary: In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are  linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.\"\n",
